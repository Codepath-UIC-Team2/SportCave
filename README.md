## Overview
### Description
An Android mobile appâ€”browse sports, view scoring updates for domestic and international games, and connect with fellow sports fans by sharing reactions.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Sports / Social
- **Mobile:** Check for scoring updates and post reactions on-the-go, use camera to post photos to reactions feed and update profile photo.
- **Story:** SportCave allows users to receive updates for different sports in one location rather than scouring different platforms for each sport. Present sports scores apps do not incorporate user profiles and social aspects; SportCave provides users the opportunity to connect with fellow fans by sharing reactions.
- **Market:** Any sports fan would enjoy this app.
- **Habit:**  Users can check back as often as they'd like, multiple times a day
- **Scope:** Initial features are to view scoring updates and to share reactions with other fans. App can be expanded to include livestreaming links and map and calendar functionalities.
